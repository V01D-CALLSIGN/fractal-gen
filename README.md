# fractal-gen
Biometric Data fractal generator (Highseas randomizer project idea)
shout out to the little turtle on high seas for giving me this idea. 
## how it works: 
### you insert a number 60-120 and it zooms in or out on a fractal
### pretty straightforward, and I think this is just a fun little project with little utility.
